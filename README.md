## Introduction

Everyone is in a rush to go to 
places they want to go, without having to wait 
for the available facilities.The problem here 
is mismanagement of bus services for carrying 
passengers leading either to starvation of 
service to people or under-utilization of 
bus services.

## Problem

Due to the static allocation of buses, the buses
are not able to fulfill demand at places or run empty.

## Solution

The Dynamic Bus Management System - Robus, provides
a solution to tackle this.

Apart from the static buses that are scheduled, we deploy
additional buses when the demand is more than the supply.
These additional buses are kept at places called Hotspots, which are 
open places around the city where multiple route interact.
